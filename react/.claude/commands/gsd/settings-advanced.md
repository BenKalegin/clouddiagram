<objective>
Interactive configuration of GSD power-user knobs that don't belong in the common-case `/gsd-settings` prompt.

Routes to the settings-advanced workflow which handles:
- Config existence ensuring (workstream-aware path resolution)
- Current settings reading and parsing
- Sectioned prompts: Planning Tuning, Execution Tuning, Discussion Tuning, Cross-AI Execution, Git Customization, Runtime / Output
- Config merging that preserves every unrelated key
- Confirmation table display

Use `/gsd-settings` for the common-case toggles (model profile, research/plan_check/verifier, branching strategy, context warnings). Use `/gsd-settings-advanced` once those are set and you want to tune the internals.

<process>
**Follow the settings-advanced workflow** from `@/Users/veniamin.kalegin/repos/github/clouddiagram/react/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/settings-advanced.md`.

The workflow handles all logic including:
1. Config file creation with defaults if missing (via `gsd-sdk query config-ensure-section`)
2. Current config reading
3. Six sectioned AskUserQuestion batches with current values pre-selected
4. Numeric-input validation (non-numeric rejected, empty input keeps current)
5. Answer parsing and config merging (preserves unrelated keys)
6. File writing (atomic)
7. Confirmation table display
