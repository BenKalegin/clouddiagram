- [ ] 4. Optimize state selectors to reduce unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] 5. Add comprehensive state validation to prevent invalid states

### Project Structure
- [X] 6. Reorganize feature folders to better separate concerns (e.g., separate view components from state logic)
- [ ] 7. Create a dedicated services layer for cross-cutting concerns
- [ ] 8. Implement a proper module system with clear boundaries between features

- [ ] 20. Add test coverage reporting

### Code Style and Consistency
- [ ] 21. Implement consistent error handling patterns
- [ ] 22. Add comprehensive TypeScript types for all components and functions
- [ ] 23. Refactor component props to use consistent naming conventions
- [ ] 24. Add proper JSDoc comments to all public functions and components
- [ ] 25. Set up linting rules to enforce code style consistency

### Refactoring
- [ ] 26. Refactor diagram rendering logic to reduce duplication between diagram types
- [ ] 27. Extract common UI components from feature-specific implementations
- [ ] 28. Simplify complex conditional rendering in components
- [ ] 29. Refactor the linking mechanism to improve maintainability
- [ ] 30. Improve type safety in the diagram model

## Feature Improvements

### User Experience
- [ ] 31. Implement undo/redo functionality for all diagram operations
